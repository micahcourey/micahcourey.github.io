          <h1>About Me</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="card-section">
          <p>In 2012 I made the decision to turn my life long interest and fascination in technology into a career. I decided that to achieve my new found goals as efficiently as possible I should go back to school full time.</p>

          <p>I attended Chattahoochee Technical College majoring in Computer Information Systems Technology. I enjoyed my classes and I learned a lot while earning my degree and in the process I found my biggest passion in technology was in programming and web development.</p>

          <p>After I graduated I decided to continue my education to gain all the skills I would need to become a Web Developer. After many hours of researching schools and programs all across the country I came to the conclusion that Epicodus located in Portland, OR was the best place for me. I felt that a program like Epicodus would prepare me for all of the technical and non technical skills I wanted to improve on such as working on team projects and pair programming.</p>

          <p>It turned out to be a great decision because I learned so many new things during my time at Epicodus. Iâ€™m also very happy living in Portland and in January of 2016 I started my technology career as a Software QA Analyst and Web Developer at Plus QA. I was able to learn and improve my problem solving and analytical skills in this position. In early 2017 I decided it was time to take the next step with my career by pursuing a position that would allow me to grow more as a developer.</p>

          <p>In June, 2017 I began a new position as a Front-End Web Application Developer at Stevens Water Monitoring Systems. In the time since I started this position I've designed and developed a large-scale Angular web application from the ground up and we are planning to release this new product to our customers at the end of Q1 2018.</p>
